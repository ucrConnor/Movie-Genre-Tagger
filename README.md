# Movie-Genre-Tagger

movie_genre_tagger.py is the main classifying program.

preprocess.py processes wiki_movie_plots_deduped.csv into movie_preprocess which is used by movie_genre_tagger.py

wiki_movie_plots_deduped.csv is taken from https://www.kaggle.com/jrobischon/wikipedia-movie-plots

movie_preprocess is given so you don't need to run preprocess.py, is the exact file it would output.

test_movies is  the file containing the movies to be tagged.
